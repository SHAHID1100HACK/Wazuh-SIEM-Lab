# PROJECTNAME

## Objective
This lab was built to simulate brute-force SSH attacks and detect them through centralized logging and alerting. Using a lightweight SIEM stack, the project focused on collecting logs from Linux systems, visualizing authentication events, and simulating adversary behavior to trigger detection and incident response.

### Skills Learned
- Core SIEM concepts (log ingestion, search, alerting)
- SSH brute force detection techniques
- Security event correlation and analysis
- Incident documentation and triage reporting
- Linux authentication and system logs

### Tools Used
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Filebeat for log forwarding
- Linux (Ubuntu) auth.log
- Markdown for incident reports
